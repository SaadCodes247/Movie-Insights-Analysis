# Request From Line Manager:
### This is the end of module assignment for Programmatic Data Wrangling, where you'll be performing Exploratory Data Analysis and draw insights from a small, but comprehensive movie data.

1. Your single deliverable to submit is 1 ipynb file containing all your exploration.

2. It is expected that your notebook is thoroughly annotated & code commented for it to be easily accessed & interpreted. 

3. Your task is to freely explore the data & draw insights from it. However, the following outcomes are expected:

    * 3 Python visualisations showcasing insights drawn from the data
    * 2 keypoints drawn from the data - explicitly stated in Markdown format and explained by your code & findings. What did you find most interesting? Or most surprising? Why is that?
    * Select 2 movies on which to provide a more in-depth single observation analysis. Why have you selected these two? What's interesting about them? How do they compare to similar movies?

**These are minimal requirements for this project. Feel free to both expand on them, as well as set more targets for your own exploration!**

# Feedback for Presentation:

1. You delivered an outstanding presentation, starting with a fabulous introduction that clearly outlined what you would cover. This immediately set the stage and made it easy for your audience to follow along.  

2. Your storytelling was a real highlight - you provided great insight into your train of thought, guiding the audience through your analysis in a way that was both logical and engaging. The variety of visualisations you used kept things interesting and helped illustrate your points effectively. Each chart felt purposeful, and your ability to delve deeper into key insights demonstrated strong analytical thinking.  

3. One of the most impressive aspects was how you instilled curiosity throughout the presentation. Your narrative made the viewer want to learn more as you progressed, which is a true mark of compelling communication.  

4. Your key takeaway at the end was particularly strong. You addressed me directly as the stakeholder, summarising your recommendations and making it clear what actions you suggest we focus on when making movies. This not only showed excellent audience awareness but also ensured your analysis was actionable and relevant.  

5. Your delivery was clear, concise, and easy to follow. You spoke at a measured pace, using your voice to emphasise important points - this made your insights land with even greater impact. 

**Key strengths:**

  * Strong, actionable key insights and recommendations 
  * Great variety and use of visualisations  
  * Instilled curiosity and kept the audience engaged
